# Algorithm: “ATA 2015 Thyroid Nodule Evaluation Decision Logic”

This document outlines the decision-making logic used in the Thyroid Nodule Evaluation module, based on the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 guidelines.

### Step 1: Check for hot nodule (scintigraphy pre-check)

If a patient's TSH is low (< 0.4 mIU/L) or a scintigraphy scan shows a "hot" (hyperfunctioning) nodule, the evaluation for malignancy typically stops.

- **Action:** No FNA
- **Rationale:** Hyperfunctioning (hot) nodules have a negligible malignancy risk.

### Step 2: Override Rule – Suspicious Lymph Node

The presence of a suspicious lymph node is a strong indicator of malignancy and overrides other criteria.

- **Action:** FNA of node (regardless of nodule size)
- **Rationale:** A cervical lymph node suspicious for metastasis requires immediate investigation, starting with the node itself.

### Step 3: Ultrasound (US) Pattern Classification & FNA Decision

If the above conditions are not met, the nodule is classified based on its ultrasound features to determine risk and the need for a biopsy. The action is determined by comparing the nodule's diameter to the category's threshold.

| **Pattern**              | **Diagnostic Criteria**                                                                                                                              | **Risk %** | **FNA Threshold** |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **High Suspicion**       | Solid or partially cystic + hypoechoic/markedly hypoechoic **AND** ≥1 of: irregular/lobulated margins, taller-than-wide, microcalcifications, or ETE. | 70–90%     | **≥ 10 mm**       |
| **Intermediate Suspicion** | Solid hypoechoic with smooth margins, **and no** high-risk features.                                                                                 | 10–20%     | **≥ 10 mm**       |
| **Low Suspicion**        | Isoechoic/hyperechoic ± partially cystic, smooth margins, and no suspicious features.                                                                  | 5–10%      | **≥ 15 mm**       |
| **Very Low Suspicion**   | Spongiform or partially cystic without any suspicious features.                                                                                        | <3%        | **≥ 20 mm**       |
| **Benign Pattern**       | Purely cystic nodule.                                                                                                                                | ~0%        | **No FNA**        |

- **Action if below threshold:** If a nodule's diameter is smaller than the FNA threshold for its category, the recommended action is **Observation** with follow-up ultrasound.
- **Action for Very Low Suspicion ≥ 20mm:** The action is **Optional FNA or Observation**, decided based on clinical judgment and patient preference.
- **Unclassified:** If a nodule's features do not fit any category, the recommended action is **Clinical correlation and follow-up**, typically with a repeat ultrasound in 12-24 months.
